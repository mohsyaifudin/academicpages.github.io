I am a master of science graduate from [UGM](https://www.ugm.ac.id/). Starting from September 2022, I'm taking a Data Science programme at [DQ Labs](https://www.dqlab.id/) financed by [Digitalent Kominfo](https://digitalent.kominfo.go.id/). Prior to that, I was a chemistry teacher at [Semesta Bilingual Boarding School](https://semesta.sch.id/).  My research interests are in computational chemistry, especially quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) analyst. I obtained an MSc in Chemistry from [Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://www.ugm.ac.id/) in 2019 and BSc in Chemistry from [Universitas Negeri Semarang](https://www.unnes.ac.id/) in 2015.
